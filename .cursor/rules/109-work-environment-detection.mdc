# Work Environment Detection Rule

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- Automatically detect if user is in company or home environment based on time
- Adapt development approach and tool usage accordingly
- Company: Mon-Fri 8:00-17:00 (no VR headset available)
- Home: Mon-Fri after 17:00, weekends all day (VR headset available)

## Requirements
- Use terminal command `Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss dddd"` to get current time
- Parse weekday and time to determine environment
- Company environment: Focus on documentation, code editing, non-VR tasks
- Home environment: Can include VR testing, headset-dependent features
- Update work priorities based on environment constraints
